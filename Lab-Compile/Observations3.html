    <h1>Observations:</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>There are two HTML documents in the code, representing two separate webpages: "First Page" and "Second Page."</li>
        <li>In the "First Page," there is an "h1" heading with the text "PICTURE OF YOUR CRUSH."</li>
        <li>In the "First Page," there is an anchor "a" element with the text "Click here!" that links to the "Second Page" with the file name "mod2-3_Betonio_2.html."</li>
        <li>In the "Second Page," there is an "h1" heading with the text "My Favorite Character (your crush)."</li>
        <li>The "Second Page" includes an "img" element with the src attribute set to "crush.jpg," which presumably displays an image of the "crush."</li>
        <li>The image has an "alt" attribute set to "your crush," providing alternative text for the image.</li>
        <li>In the "Second Page," there is a "p" element containing a paragraph describing the image and expressing admiration for the person depicted.</li>
    </ul>
